<h1>Developing custom data visualizations for a biometric system</h1>

<section>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>From 2015 to 2020, I designed and developed web applications for a medical-grade wearable device, using React, Redux and SVG.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Our system captured high-resolution physiological data—up to 1,000 samples <i>per second</i>—and displayed it to users in novel ways. <i>We needed a visualization library that supported unconventional designs.</i></p>

<h3>Solution</h3> 

<p>I selected <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a>, a library for manipulating and transforming data into visual components. With D3, I could do things that weren't possible with traditional charting libraries, such as creating irregular scales. And with D3's extensive set of <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/API.md" target="_blank">utilities</a>, I could work with data at all levels of resolution, from <i>daily</i> to <i>hourly</i> to <i>sub-second</i>:</p>

<h3>The code</h3>

<p>To visualize resting posture, as shown in the first screenshot above, I plotted 1-minute posture samples across two dimensions, the coronal plane (x) and the sagittal plane (y), and exaggerated the area of interest (+/-45 degrees in both planes) using an irregular scale:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>D3 was an excellent choice for creating non-standard, proprietary data visualizations. For conventional charting, I like <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" target="_blank">ECharts</a>, but for the crazy stuff I'll stick with D3!</p>
