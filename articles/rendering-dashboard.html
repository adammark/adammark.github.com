<h1>Rendering a dashboard in half a second</h1>

<section>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Since 2023, I've been developing analytical tools for a clinical trial management system using TypeScript and React.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Our existing reporting solution was slow to render and cumbersome to use. <i>We needed a fast, responsive reporting framework.</i></p>
</section>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>I developed a new UI with the goal that it should render within <em>500 milliseconds</em> and handle subsequent user interactions within <em>300 milliseconds</em>, then applied these benchmarks to even the most complex, multifaceted view of data:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img-dashboard-snapshot.png" width="100%"/></p>

<p>The above pictured dashboard contains six charts and utilizes eight API endpoints, yet it begins rendering in under <em>200 milliseconds</em> and finishes rendering in under <em>350 milliseconds</em> with no layout shifts:</p>

<p>How did I do it? Actually, it was a team effort. First, my teammate built snappy REST API endpoints to meet the response-time target of 300 milliseconds. We made sure every endpoint could stand on its own, such that the UI would never need to load endpoints in a waterfall, or cascading, pattern.</p>

<p>On the front end, I employed a variety of techniques to make the UI feel lightning fast:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I used a foundational <a href="https://reshaped.so/" target="_blank">component library</a> that allowed me to cherry-pick just the few widgets I needed. This cut down on my bundle size (and the time it takes for the browser to load it).</li>
  <li>I used a Canvas-based <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">data visualization library</a> rather one that relied on SVG, which would burden the DOM and make the UI feel sluggish. (See <a href="selecting-data-viz.html">Selecting the right data visualization library</a>)</li>
  <li>I <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/memo" target="_blank">memoized</a> components to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.</li>
  <li>I aggressively cached queries using a <a href="https://tanstack.com/query/latest" target="_blank">data fetching</a> library.</li>
  <li>I ensured all requests for data could be made in parallel.</li>
  <li>I rendered all data visualization elements immediately, even before data was loaded. This way, they served as the "skeleton" of the page and made loading feel instantaneous.</li>
  <li>I avoided gratuitous animations, which would delay the visual processing of data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Building a better dashboard started with a simple objective: that it should load in under half a second. Now comes the hard part: maintaining this level of performance as the application grows in scale and scope.</p>
