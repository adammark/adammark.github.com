I’m happy to announce the publication of my first tutorial on HTML5Rocks.com:
[Converting Wordico from Flash to HTML5][1]. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, but
most of all you’ll see what’s involved in migrating a Flash app to HTML5 with
the help of [GWT][4] and lots of coffee. While you’re on the site, check out
how [Entanglement][2] and [Onslaught Arena!][3] were made.
