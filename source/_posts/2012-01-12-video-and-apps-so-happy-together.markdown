What do macaroni and cheese, peanut butter and jelly, and franks and beans
have in common? Yes, they're all delicious. But more importantly, in each case
_the whole is greater than the sum of its individual parts_. Peanut butter by
itself is delicious, but it's made better with jelly. I feel the same way
about video and apps:

* Video breathes life into apps while apps provide a contextual framework for
discovering and delivering video.

* Video depends on the entire app landscape (phones, tablets, web sites, and
smart TVs) for broad distribution. Likewise, the app landscape depends on
pluggable, reusable forms of content like video.

* Video drives engagement and engagement drives app usage.

Meanwhile, the [growth of mobile video][1] is staggering. Apps that deliver
great video experiences to a broad array of devices and platforms stand to
benefit from this trend. And content owners stand to benefit from using
services that facilitate a multi-platform, multi-device approach.

[Brightcove App Cloud][2] makes it easy to create video-centric apps for iOS
and Android devices using content from Brightcove Video Cloud, YouTube, and
many other video services. It's an end-to-end, cross-platform publishing
solution that includes an HTML5-based SDK plus cloud-based services for
optimizing and managing content. Here's a quick look at how App Cloud content
feeds can be used to integrate videos into apps.

## App Cloud + Video Cloud

App Cloud and Video Cloud are—surprise!—tightly integrated. From App Cloud
Studio, select "New Content Source," then choose "Video Cloud," then enter a
Video Cloud Read API token:

Then it's just a matter of selecting some playlists to send to the custom
application template. Here, I've selected two playlists from my Video Cloud
account:

It's that simple. I can reorder or swap out playlists at any time, even after
the app is deployed. My changes take effect without having to repackage and
resubmit the app to the various app stores—an invaluable feature considering
how often I change my mind! In content-driven apps, this kind of flexibility
is essential.

## App Cloud + YouTube

App Cloud can also ingest data feeds (RSS, XML, JSON) from YouTube and other
video services. From App Cloud Studio, select "New Content Source," then
choose "Content Feed," then enter a feed URL:

App Cloud optimizes the feed before sending it to devices. In some cases, the
savings are dramatic:

_Every bit counts, especially in mobile apps!_ By using App Cloud as a proxy,
I can speed up my apps tremendously.

## A match made in the cloud

If video and apps are like peanut butter and jelly—a perfect food pairing—then
Video Cloud and App Cloud are a perfect collaboration of cloud content
services. One improves the other.

There's another joke to be made here about how videos are sticky, but I should
quit while I'm ahead. [Try App Cloud today][3] and see how easy it is to
create video-centric native apps for iOS and Android. It's free to get
started—all you need are some basic web development skills and a good app
idea. You can load videos from Video Cloud or almost any other video service.
And while you're at it, check out some of the other App Cloud services like
image transcoding, analytics and ad insertion. (App Cloud is like jelly ...
it's pretty sweet!)
