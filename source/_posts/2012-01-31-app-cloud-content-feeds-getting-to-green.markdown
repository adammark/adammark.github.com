I just smashed my personal content feed optimization record in [App Cloud][1].
The [original feed][2], a YouTube playlist, clocked in at 176KB. _Whoa._

So howâ€™d I do it? First, I limited the number of entries to 20 (the original
feed had 25). Then I eliminated all the fields I didn't need, leaving only
9 or 10.

The result: 20KB. _A nearly 90% reduction!_ As soon as I tamed this bad boy,
my app sped up noticeably. Not only does the payload come down faster, the app
can process it faster.
