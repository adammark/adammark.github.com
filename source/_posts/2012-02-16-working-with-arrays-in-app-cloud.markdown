[App Cloud][1] apps are voracious consumers of JavaScript arrays, which carry
all kinds of data from server to client: news articles, photo gallery
metadata, a list of places near a user's location, and even tweets. You're
probably familiar with the two basic techniques for iterating over arrays:

    for (var i = 0; i < stuff.length; i++) {
        ...
    }

and

    for (var i in stuff) {
        ...
    }

Now comes another:

    stuff.forEach(function (value, index, array) {
        ...
    });

Yeah, you read that right. And it doesn't use jQuery or any other syntactic
sugar. Here's a fuller example:

    var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

    fruits.forEach(function (value, index, array) {
        console.log(value, index, arr);
    });

Run the above code in your browser to see the outputâ€”then feel free to use
this technique in your App Cloud app.

There are some other native JavaScript methods that might look new to you:
`every()`, `filter()`, `map()` and `some()`. Read all about them in the 
[MDN docs][2].
