[App Cloud's][1] real-time image transcoding API now has a public "face" in
App Cloud Studio. Developers can use it to explore the API in a visual way
before writing a single line of code. Just enter an image URL and set a few
parameters like width, height and image quality:

It's a quick way to determine the best level of compression for some JPEG
photos or the correct cropping algorithm for a series of thumbnail images.

With image transcoding, developers can dramatically improve app performance by
reducing image sizes by _90% or more_. And it's a snap to useâ€”service URLs can
be composed at runtime with a little bit of JavaScript.

See the [App Cloud docs][2] for a complete rundown of the API.
