I recently came across an awesome [web font][1] called _Font Awesome_. How
appropriate! Each character in the font is a graphical icon instead of a
number of letter. Here's what it looks like in my [App Cloud][4] demo app
(I've circled each use):

There are a ton of great [icon fonts][3] that you can drop into your App Cloud
app without much fussâ€”just be sure the font is a TTF font so it can work on
both iOS and Android. Not only will you save a ton of time in the design
stages, these icons will look great at any size and resolution. Just adjust
the `font-size` property in your CSS!
