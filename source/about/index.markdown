![Adam Mark](/images/about/adammark.jpg)

First, I’m no relation to the Adam’s Mark Hotel. But I get that a lot.
Otherwise, I’m a web developer at [Brightcove][1], a fantastic company full 
of smart, passionate people.

Before joining Brightcove, I was technical director in the interactive
department at [Home Front Communications][2], where I developed web sites for
non-profit groups and government agencies. Earlier, I was a front-end
developer at three startup companies: [Brivo Systems][3], [Hillcrest Labs][4],
and [Netuitive][5]. At each company I learned new things about product
development, project management, and writing clean code. I also made lifelong
friends.

When I’m not working, I enjoy photography, cooking and playing piano. I live
in the Boston area with my wife, our twins and our [dog][6].

You can get in touch with me via [LinkedIn][7].
